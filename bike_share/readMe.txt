Project Idea:-
♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣
In this project, I depend on Python to explore data related to bike share systems;
for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
imported the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
also I wrote a script in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal
to present these statistics.

Software:-
♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣
•Python 3 and (NumPy, pandas packages).
•A text editor (spyder).

new in the project 
♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣
def __init__(self): to display screen window as welcome
try - errors to except the errors within any conditions
I added conditions in get_filters to adjust times of user inputs
in function display_row_data i added some Hazelnut to display all samples as indexes
and the giant new , i solved the problem of chicago not onlt by try , except 
but by the conditions i mountes in the start of function display_row_data
and adjust the filter by "not at all" by methods in mounted in get_filters under the condition of "not at all"
and at the final , end screen to the user for his time in the system

NOTE:
__init__ function and end_screen function may be not operate 
because of root problems , i suffered from it , times i need to restart the kernal, another;
need to transpose between TK , TOPLEVEL thinter , but try -- except will passes any errors


future working
♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣
build a function for times of errors.
build a function for the user to be capable of determining the number of samples he wants.
build a loop for the denied months.
make the months by abbreviation / number or >>>
by autocomleting {nice idea i loved it}
adjust the sceen window

THANKS TO ALL
♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣
I LOVED THAT COURSE VERY VERY MUCH
intensified course and learn our by newly and fantastic way to depend on our self,
to follow market challenges.
I learned how to build a project from scrach.


I run and test the project on spyder
it is nice , i don't have aproblem during testing except the root of TK
